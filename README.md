# AI driven wind forecasting model. 

Trying to predict the most exact wind range for hours and days ahead
using LSTM and some data analysis tools.

Seed for the analysis consists of:
 * GFS 0.25Â° archive forecasts from https://rda.ucar.edu
 * Synop reports from ground stations (ogimet.com, meteo.imgw.pl, meteomodel.pl)
 * Satelite images (pl.sat24.com, probably some more sources in the future)
